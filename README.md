# StolenBikes

The app can be downloaded from my Google Drive https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BcxW3CMd7RNP8a9R8n-s9iPbmUZr7PWP To install the app installation from Uknown sources has to be enabled. It is not recommended to enable 'Unknown sources' and you should preferably wait for the app to appear in Google Play.

# To allow app installs from Unknown sources, follow this steps:
1) Navigate to Setting > Security.
2) Check the option "Unknown sources".
3) Tap OK on the prompt message.
4) Select "Trust".

# About the App
Application is using Bike Index. This index enables users to register bicycles to protect them from burglars. So far, 31,356 bikes have been registered and over 2,118 stolen bikes have been recovered. In the [main site](https://bikeindex.org/documentation/api_v3) developers can find more information about the JSON API, that includes support to cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), a spec that permits web apps to make AJAX calls without workarounds.

Only the stolen bikes can be searched in the app.
